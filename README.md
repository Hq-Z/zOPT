# zOPT
This project contains an open-source implementation of an OPT platform. The 3D-printable components are provided to built your customized sample stage. We offer our open source MATLAB software with an GUI for OPT imaging. We developed a generalized automated workflow including a two-step registration approach for correcting the center of rotation and provide accurate and high-quality 3D reconstruction.

Here we previde the source code and instructions to built up the zOPT system. For sample data from the system, we provide them here,
https://sourceforge.net/projects/zopt-tomography-reconstruction.
This is a bright field OPT tomography data recorded by our zOPT setup and it can be used to verify the algorithms for zOPT tomography reconstruction.
